2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_onehot_state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_onehot_state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_onehot_state_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_onehot_state_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_onehot_state_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_onehot_state_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_onehot_state_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-13#1 Warning
Timing paths ignored due to path segmentation  
Some timing paths are not reported due to path segmentation on pin(s) y_reg/D. To prevent path segmentation, all the Min and Max delay constraints should be defined with a list of valid startpoints and endpoints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch a_dec_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin a_dec_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch y_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin y_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
